<br> i have various typing styles, but i typically shorten words and use longer ones in full (eg: ya = yes/yeah). if u dont understand dont ba afraid to ask!!! ^_^
<br>
<br> i have an extreme hyperfixation on joost klein!
<br> he's like a father figure to me so nsfw jokes about him are not appreciated at all
<br>
<br> !!! you may rant to me in discord dms / ponytown whispers, but i won't respond as i don't want to reply incorrectly
<br>
<br> other hyperfixations include --
<br> ski aggu, käärijä, 01099, ikkimel, 5miinust etc (read rentry ["tanzalarm"](https://rentry.co/tanzalarm) for more)
